# Rendering Color and Lighting with OpenGL

![](effect.gif)

## Description
This project uses the Phong lighting method to create the lighting effect of an object in openGL. In this implementation, I set the position of the light at a fixed location.

Also, we could change a random color with key "C".

Finally, we can display the smooth lighting effect via the double linear interpolation method. (not implemented here, due to tight schedule)

## Implementation Note
The direction of the normal vector of the surface: the three vertices are defaulted to be given in the counterclockwise order.
