## First Project
In folder `/hw1`.

This project enables several functions in the displaying window.

* object rotation (up, down, left, right, M, N keys)
* object movement (W, S, A, D, Z, X keys)
* display mode selection (P, F, L, O keys)
* color gradual change (R, G, B keys)

### Display Mode Selection
P: only display points
F: display triangles, in random colors
L: only display lines
O: display both triangle faces and lines

### Color Gradual Change
R, G, B represent red, green, and blue elements in the color, respectively. When we keep pressing R, for example, the red element will be fluctuating in a sinusoidal pattern. We can also press several keys at the same time.

# Navigating the Solar System

(The gif is not showing text clearly due to optimization requirements for web browser downloading.)

In this project, we draw a mini Solar System in 3D space with flat pictures of these celestial bodies given.

* Each planet is rotating around the sun, the moon rotates around the earth.
* The name of each body follows it (text).
* We are able to navigate within this 3D space with keyboard and mouse pad.
